  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a Master of Computing student at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with over a decade of experience in building data-driven and AI-powered products in multinationals and promising startups. My background spans Amazon, GE Global Research, TATA R&D, HealthTech, EdTech, FinTech, and InsureTech, where I’ve led end-to-end development of scalable information systems in forecasting, product recommendation, AI bots, analytics platforms, and full-stack software development. Currently, I am deepening and broadening my knowledge in artificial intelligence, big data systems, and web3 technologies, with a strong interest in applying AI to real-world business problems. I strive to transform knowledge into impactful and meaningful products that address real-world problems and add lasting value to society.

    Outside of my professional pursuits, I stay active and intellectually engaged through a diverse set of interests. I enjoy playing cricket, swimming, and working out at the gym, activities that help me maintain discipline and fitness and keep me in shape. I am also an avid reader with a strong interest in science fiction and finance. I am particulary drawn to ideas that explore the future, technology, and ethics. Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov are two authors whom I admire. I also have a keen interest in quantitative finance, especially inspired by the time-tested principles of value investing advocated by Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. Additionally, I love to travel and meet new people, learning about their cultures, cuisines, and lived experiences — an approach that continually enriches me and shapes my perspective on life.
